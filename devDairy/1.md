# 20-Aug-2025: Implementing URL Shortening And Redirecting Features

## Features

- Home page for public users.
- Short urls generating
- Urls rediraction
- Public urls analytics

## MY Approach

### Home Page For Public Users:

- identify client (client or user)
- find all urls using (clientId, or user.\_id)
- render home page with `error, success, urls`

## Facing Problems

- too much thinking about perfaction
- cookies handling
- mechanism to identify visiters

## Solutions

- firstly make it working, can make perfact later
- use cookie-parser package
- can use middleware for visiters identifications. using cookies for public clients to store clientId used for identifying urls, not worry about those urls because it auto deleted after 2 days by using TTL index.
